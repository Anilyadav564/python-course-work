'''| Keyword | Simple meaning |
|---|---|
| `False` | Represents a false condition/value. |
| `None` | Represents no value or an empty value. |
| `True` | Represents a true condition/value. |
| `and` | True only when both conditions are true. |
| `as` | Gives another name while importing or using something. |
| `assert` | Checks a condition and gives an error if it is false. |
| `async` | Creates an asynchronous function. |
| `await` | Waits for an asynchronous task to finish. |
| `break` | Immediately stops a loop. |
| `class` | Creates a class. |
| `continue` | Skips the current loop turn and goes to the next one. |
| `def` | Creates a function. |
| `del` | Deletes a variable or item. |
| `elif` | Checks another condition after `if`. |
| `else` | Runs when the `if` condition is false. |
| `except` | Handles an error from `try`. |
| `finally` | Runs whether an error happens or not. |
| `for` | Repeats code for each item. |
| `from` | Imports a specific item from a module. |
| `global` | Uses a global variable inside a function. |
| `if` | Runs code only when a condition is true. |
| `import` | Brings a module into the program. |
| `in` | Checks whether an item exists in something. |
| `is` | Checks whether two variables refer to the same object. |
| `lambda` | Creates a small one-line function. |
| `nonlocal` | Uses a variable from the nearest outer function. |
| `not` | Reverses True to False, or False to True. |
| `or` | True when at least one condition is true. |
| `pass` | Does nothing; used as a placeholder. |
| `raise` | Creates/throws an error intentionally. |
| `return` | Sends a value back from a function. |
| `try` | Runs code that may cause an error. |
| `while` | Repeats code while a condition is true. |
| `with` | Safely works with resources such as files. |
| `yield` | Returns values one at a time from a function. |'''
